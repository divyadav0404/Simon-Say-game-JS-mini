# Simon-Say-game-JS-mini
A mini project , in which Javascript is used as main lang.
The Simon Says Game is a fun and interactive memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to test and improve the player's memory by following an ever-increasing sequence of colors generated by the computer.

Each level adds a new color to the sequence, and the player must replicate the pattern correctly to advance. If the player clicks the wrong color, the game ends, and they can restart to try again. The game features:

A clean and responsive UI

Random pattern generation using JavaScript

User input validation

Level tracking and restart functionality

Audio and visual feedback for interaction

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts like event handling, arrays, timing functions, and DOM manipulation, making it a great beginner-friendly mini project to practice interactive front-end development.
