ðŸŽ® Simon Says Game â€“ Mini Project
The Simon Says Game is a fun, interactive, and memory-based project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It challenges players to test and improve their memory skills by following an ever-growing sequence of colors generated by the computer.
ðŸš€ How it Works
At each level, a new random color is added to the sequence.
The player must repeat the exact sequence by clicking the colored buttons.
If the player makes a mistake, the game ends â€” but they can restart anytime and try again.
The difficulty keeps increasing as the sequence grows longer, making it addictive and engaging.
